Create nested resource routes to show all songs for an artist (/artists/1/songs) and individual songs for that artist (/artists/1/songs/1). Restrict the nested songs routes to index and show actions only.
Update the artists index view to use the new nested resource route URL helper to link to the index of all songs by that artist.
Update the artists show view to list each song for that artist, and use the new nested resource route helper to link each song to its corresponding show page.
Update the songs_controller to allow the songs#index and songs#show actions to handle a valid song for the artist.
In the songs#index action, if the artist can't be found, redirect to the index of artists, and set a flash[:alert] of "Artist not found."
In the songs#show action, if the song can't be found for a given artist, redirect to the index of the artist's songs and set a flash[:alert] of "Song not found."
